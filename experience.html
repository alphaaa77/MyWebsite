                    <li>Research And Development Project: Summarize Citizen Submissions Using AI</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>During my time in AUT, my most notable project I worked on was with a R&D team to help the Palmerston City Council(PNCC) help develop an AI program to summarize their citizen submissions.
                            This AI program would help them sort through thousands of citizen submissions, summarize what their submission is about and sort how urgent their request is.
                            During my time on this project, I developed strong teamwork skills, as well as a basic understanding of working with a client and basic software development practices.

                        <li>During my time in AUT, we were tasked with developing an application of our own.
                            This could be a website, a smartphone app, a desktop app, or even a game, so long as some form of software development was involved.
                            Our group decided to make a small, 2D mobile game.
