                <p>Hello! My name is Hugh Magallanes. I am an inspiring software/web developer.</p>

                <h1>About Myself!</h1>
                <p>Currently based in Sydney but I grew up in New Zealand. Been sat at a computer for basically my whole life, there was never a time where I haven't been around a computer. 
                    I studied at Auckland University of Technology where I graduated and received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer And Information Sciences.
                My major was in Software Development with a minor in Data Science.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Outside of software development, I also have a passion for games and game development.
                    I have worked on some small Unity developments while studying, as well as venturing Unity development on my own.
                    I have also done basic video editing for YouTube and Tiktok, for my gaming hobby.
                </p>

                <h1>My Experience</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Research And Development Project: Summarize Citizen Submissions Using AI</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>During my time in AUT, my most notable project I worked on was with a R&D team to help the Palmerston City Council(PNCC) help develop an AI program to summarize their citizen submissions.
                            This AI program would help them sort through thousands of citizen submissions, summarize what their submission is about and sort how urgent their request is.
                            During my time on this project, I developed strong teamwork skills, as well as a basic understanding of working with a client and basic software development practices.

                    <br>
                    <li>Unity Project (University Project)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>During my time in AUT, we were tasked with developing an application of our own.
                            This could be a website, a smartphone app, a desktop app, or even a game, so long as some form of software development was involved.
                            Our group decided to make a small, 2D mobile game.
